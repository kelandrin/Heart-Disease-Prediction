# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Trying to predict heart disease based on metrics that a heart doctor would take.

      -- 1. age       
      -- 2. Sex
Male = 1       
      -- 3. chest pain type  (4 values)(Cp)
-- Value 1: typical angina
-- Value 2: atypical angina
-- Value 3: non-anginal pain
-- Value 4: asymptomatic
       
      -- 4. resting blood pressure (Trestbps) 
in mmhg 
      -- 5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl (chol)
in mg/dl      
      -- 6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (fbs)      
      -- 7. resting electrocardiographic results  (values 0,1,2) (restecg)
-- Value 0: normal
-- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
-- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

      -- 8. maximum heart rate achieved (maxhr) 
      -- 9. exercise induced angina (exang)
1 yes
0 no
      -- 10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
ST depression refers to a finding on an electrocardiogram,[1][2] wherein the trace in the ST segment is abnormally low below the baseline.
   
      -- 11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope)
-- Value 1: upsloping
-- Value 2: flat
-- Value 3: downsloping

     
      -- 12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy (ca)        
      -- 13.  thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
